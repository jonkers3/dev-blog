For certain projects it's very convenient to run an NPM task automatically when opening their folder in VS Code. Use `presentation.reveal` to control whether the terminal is automatically shown.

```json file=.vscode/tasks.json
{
  // See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=733558
  // for the documentation about the tasks.json format
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "npm start",
      "type": "shell",
      "command": "npm start",
      "windows": {
        "command": "npm start"
      },
      "presentation": {
        "reveal": "always",
        "panel": "new"
      },
      "runOptions": { "runOn": "folderOpen" }
    },

    ...
  ]
}
```

The next time you open the folder, if it doesn't prompt you for permission `Ctrl + Shift + P` and search for `Tasks: Manage Automatic Tasks in Folder` and set to allow.
