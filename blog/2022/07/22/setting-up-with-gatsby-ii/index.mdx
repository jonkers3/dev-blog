# Deploying Our New Dev Blog

Today we will deploying the new Gatsby-based dev blog that we worked through setting up [here](/2022/07/20/setting-up-with-gatsby/).

<br/>

## 1. We Want Automated Builds and Easy Deployment
---

For the time being, I'm just going to deploy to Github Pages. I will hook up a custom domain later. My main concern at the moment is just being able to add content and deploy changes to the site as effortlessly as possible. So now we go to Github.

<br/>

## 2. Setup a repository on Github
---

Create yourself a new, empty repository on Github. We made ours [here](https://github.com/jonkers3/dev-blog).

The Gatsby CLI initialized a git repository for us at the very beginning of this. We need to commit our changes eventually, but first we should setup SSH access to Github. This will make everything much easier down the road.

### Create an SSH key (use your own email)
```sh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C 'me@my-email.com'

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Copy the output of `cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` to the clipboard, paste it [here](https://github.com/settings/ssh/new). Give it a name and save it, then verify that it is working by running `ssh -T git@github.com`.

### Add a remote and push our code to Github.
```sh
git remote add origin git@github.com:jonkers3/dev-blog.git

git push --set-upstream origin master
```

Now we can just commit changes and call `git push` to have them pushed right to the master branch on Github.

At this point we should have our code live on Github in the _master_ branch. Let's see what it takes to get it deployed as an actual website.

<br/>

## 3. Setup Github Pages
---

[This template](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/github-pages-action) appears to be just the sort of things we are looking for: something that makes it really easy way to deploy a static site to Github Pages. And it does do that. In fact, creating this one file is almost the only thing we need to do.

#### `.github/workflows/gh-pages.js`
```yml
name: GitHub Pages

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master
  pull_request:

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    permissions:
      contents: write
    concurrency:
      group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Setup Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'

      - name: Cache dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: ~/.npm
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-node-

      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build

      - name: Deploy
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        if: ${{ github.ref == 'refs/heads/master' }}
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./public
```

Commit this new file and merge it into the master branch. Goto the Settings page for the Github repository, and make sure Branch is set to `gh-pages` and the selected folder is `root`; in other words make sure it is setup like it is in this picture:

Once those things are setup correct;y, that should be it. Pushing changes to Github (`git push`) now triggers our workflow, and the process culminates in a new version of the site being deployed to Github Pages. Seems to take around two minutes from `git push` to live.

## 4. Update gatsby-config to fix images
---

Due to the nature of our Github Pages setup, we need to make the following change to ensure that all of our images and links are working right. Of course this string value needs to match the name of the repository in Github:

#### *`gatsby-config.ts`*
```javascript

+ pathPrefix: 'dev-blog', // https://jonkers3.github.io/dev-blog <-

  siteMetadata: ...
```

Now that we're in our home on Github Pages, the extra `blog` in our URL has become completely redundant, so let's get rid of it. We can fix this pretty easily just by moving the files in the `src/pages/blog` folder into `src/pages` instead. Fix the paths of the imports in the files to reflect this change, and that should do it.

#### *`src/pages/index.js`*
```sh
mv src/pages/blog/index.js src/pages/index.js
mv src/pages/blog/{mdx.slug}.js src/pages/{mdx.slug}.js
```

#### *`src/pages/{mdx.slug}.js`*

```jsx
+ import Code from '../components/Code'
- import Code from '../../components/Code'

+ import Layout from '../components/Layout'
- import Layout from '../../components/Layout'
```

#### *`src/pages/index.js`*
```jsx
- import Layout from '../../components/Layout'
+ import Layout from '../components/Layout'
```

<br/>

## 6. Commit changes and push to Github
---

```sh
git commit -a -u -m 'initial deploy' && git push
```

At this point, your blog should be looking good on Github Pages. For now, we're up here: [https://jonkers3.github.io/dev-blog](https://jonkers3.github.io/dev-blog).
